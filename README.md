# Project Name

This project is built with **React** and **Vite**, which provides a fast and efficient development experience. 

## Why Vite for React?

Vite is well-suited for React projects because:
- **Blazing Fast Dev Server**: Vite starts the development server almost instantly, making hot module replacement (HMR) extremely fast, which is ideal for React's component-based structure.
- **Efficient Build Process**: Vite leverages Rollup under the hood for production builds, optimizing code splitting and minimizing bundle sizes.
- **Modern JavaScript Support**: It uses native ES modules in development, enabling faster browser loading without unnecessary bundling.
- **Flexible and Configurable**: Vite is easy to configure for a wide variety of projects and supports various plugins for extending functionality.
